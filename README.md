- You're still missing SIDs in this file.
- Put changelog into a single file changelog.md (or .txt), not a directory.
- Your licenses file should end in ".txt"
- Not enough commits + changelog items to pass at this frequency.
- I couldn't find your text-based data. Create a root folder "data/" and put all your JSON files in there.


- Reply 
JSON files are in this root directory "\Assets\Resources\GameJSONData" as per Unity Project structure

- This project seems to have stopped work? I haven't seen any update in days.
- This file still needs compile instructions, and directory explanation so I know where to find stuff.
- Your changelog needs a lot of work
- Your data hasn't progressed enough. You need to get to this very quickly, as you can't start building your game until you can at least load the levels/world of your game. So work on getting loading working (from data files) asap.
